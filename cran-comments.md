## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have transformed the S3 classes into S4 classes and parallelized much of the code. I also cleaned up some of the code by removing unneeded comments and unused function calls.

## Test Environments

* local Windows 10 Home install, R 4.0.5

* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS xenial (travis ci), R 4.0.2

* r-hub and win_check

## R CMD check results
