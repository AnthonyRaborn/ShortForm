## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I added three different checks of user input to ensure that improper arguments do not result in errors within the iterations of the algorithms. These checks occur "behind the scene" and provide informative error messages when arguments do not pass.

## Test Environments

* local Windows 10 Home version 1809, R 3.6.2

* Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS xenial (travis ci), R 3.6.1

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes
