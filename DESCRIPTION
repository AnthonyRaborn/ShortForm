Description: Performs automatic creation of short forms of scales with an ant colony optimization algorithm. As implemented in the package, 
  the algorithm randomly selects items to build a model of a prespecified length, 
  then updates the probability of item selection according to the fit of 
  the best model within each set of searches. The algorithm continues until 
  the same items are selected by multiple ants a given number of times in a row.
