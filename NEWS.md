# Package v0.4.0
## New functionality: Tabu Search

* The Tabu search has been added to the package, with user-facing functions `tabu.sem()` and `search.prep()` for most of the heavy lifting and various helper and internal functions. The code was taken primarily from Carl Falk and Katerina Marcoulides (see Marcoulides, K. M., & Falk, C. F. (2018). Model Specification Searches in Structural Equation Modeling with R. Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 1-8.). These have been tested in limited circumstances, so please report any bugs as you find them!
* No bugs have been found in the package thus far, but just a reminder for any users that bug reports are helpful and welcome.
